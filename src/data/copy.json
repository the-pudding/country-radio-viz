That means 333 songs, 270 of which are by women. The majority (roughly 65%) of songs included in this playlist are songs that were actually played on country radio between 2000–2022. For the remaining 35% we took DJ liberties and added in noteworthy classic hits, songs from unsigned artists, and a few sentimental favorites. Unlike radio, we avoided playing songs more than once (because that would be annoying on a playlist!). We also limited artists to a maximum of 5 songs, not including collaborations.

Radio played a big role in her musical development – she spent many weekends taping weekly countdowns (often on her parents’ old cassettes – oops! Sorry!), using those recordings to teach herself to play radio hits on piano. This was in the mid-1990s, when songs by women in country and other genres were in higher rotation on radio playlists and better-represented on the charts. Today, she focuses her research on representation on popularity charts and in radio programming, evaluating the rate at which songs by women, artists of color, and LGBTQ+ artists are played on country and other formats across the USA and Canada.
