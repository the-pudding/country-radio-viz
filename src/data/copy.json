An average of 40% of women back-to-back plays are gold songs, meaning that there’s reduced room for today’s biggest women country stars like Maren Morris, Miranda Lambert, and Lainey Wilson, who are among 2022’s most-played artists."},{"type":"text","value":"Now, no one’s hating on Carrie or Taylor — their classics deserve lasting airplay — but it does seem like country radio largely avoids today’s women’s hits."},{"type":"text","value":"And when current songs do get played, it’s often the same handful of artists. If you took out the top 3 current women artists you’d be left with just x% of songs, compared to X% if you did the same for men."},{"type":"text","value":"So women have the salad stacked against them: they are played less often overall, less often back-to-back, less often during prime listening hours, and less often even if they have new music."},{"type":"text","value":"If women are this poorly represented on country radio day-to-day, that means that artists of color, women artists of color, queer artists, and those at all the intersections are even worse off. <a href=https://www.google.com/url?q=https://songdata.ca/2023/03/18/redlining-in-country-music-2-0-where-do-things-stand-today-on-representation-within-the-industry/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1681234652525644&usg=AOvVaw00dvupqQBYchAFfbz_vK5E>Non-binary and trans artists are nonexistent</a> on mainstream country radio."},{"type":"text","value":"Where back-to-back plays by women were on average 0.50% of all plays, back-to-back plays by all artists of color averaged 0.41% and back-to-back plays by women artists of color were non-existent."},{"type":"text","value":"So not only is country radio not playing the “tomatoes” of the salad, it’s not playing the cucumbers, or the carrots, or the celery, or the croutons, or even the dressing.
